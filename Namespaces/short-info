$ kubectl get ns
NAME                   STATUS   AGE
default                Active   73m
ingress-nginx          Active   15m
kube-node-lease        Active   73m
kube-public            Active   73m
kube-system            Active   73m
kubernetes-dashboard   Active   58m



Certainly, let me explain the **output** of the kubectl get ns command:

NAME: This column shows the names of the namespaces in your Kubernetes cluster.

STATUS: The STATUS column indicates the current status of each namespace. In this case:

Active means the namespace is currently running and available.
Other possible statuses could include Terminating or Terminated if a namespace is being deleted.
AGE: The AGE column shows the amount of time that has passed since the namespaces were created.

Here's what each of the namespaces listed in your output represents:

default: This is the default namespace where objects are placed if you don't specify a different namespace.

ingress-nginx: This namespace is used for the Ingress Nginx controller. It manages external access to services in the cluster.

kube-node-lease: This namespace is used by nodes to inform the control plane about their availability and health.

kube-public: This namespace contains resources that should be made available to all users. It's typically used for information like ClusterStatus or ConfigMap.

kube-system: This namespace contains resources used by Kubernetes itself and is generally reserved for cluster-related components and control plane operations.

kubernetes-dashboard: This namespace is used for the Kubernetes Dashboard, a web-based UI for managing and monitoring the cluster.

These are some of the standard namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster, and they serve different purposes in managing and organizing resources within the cluster. The output shows that they are all currently in an active state, meaning they are running and functioning as expected.

#Commands for namespaces 




Certainly, there are several useful commands and operations you can 
perform on namespaces in Kubernetes. Here are some commonly used kubectl commands for working with namespaces:

Create a New Namespace:
You can create a new namespace using the kubectl create namespace or 
kubectl create ns command. For example:


kubectl create namespace my-namespace
Switch to a Namespace:
You can change your current context to a specific namespace using the 
kubectl config set-context command. For example, to switch to the "my-namespace"
namespace:


kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace
List Namespaces:
As you've seen, you can list all namespaces with kubectl get namespaces or 
use the shorter command kubectl get ns.

Delete a Namespace:
To delete a namespace and all its resources, you can use kubectl delete namespace.
For example:


kubectl delete namespace my-namespace
Describe a Namespace:
You can get detailed information about a specific namespace using kubectl 
describe namespace. For example:


kubectl describe namespace my-namespace
View Resources in a Namespace:
To see all resources within a specific namespace, you can use kubectl get
with the -n flag. For example, to list all pods in the "my-namespace" namespace:


kubectl get pods -n my-namespace
Change Namespace in a Single Command:
You can use the -n flag to specify the namespace for a single command 
without switching the current context. For example:


kubectl get pods -n my-namespace
Edit Namespace:
To edit the properties of a namespace, you can use kubectl edit namespace. 
This opens the namespace configuration in your default text editor.

Export Namespace Configuration:
You can export the configuration of a namespace to a YAML file for backup or 
version control. For example:


kubectl get namespace my-namespace -o yaml > my-namespace-config.yaml
These commands allow you to create, manage, and interact with namespaces in a
Kubernetes cluster, helping you organize and isolate resources for different 
applications, teams, or purposes.
